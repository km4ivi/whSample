Description: Interactive tools for generating random samples. Users select an
    .xlsx or .csv file with population data and are walked through selecting the
    sample type (Simple Random Sample or Stratified), the number of backups
    desired, and a "stratify_on" value (if desired). An .xlsx file is created
    with the sample and key metadata for reference. It is menu-driven and lets
    users pick an output directory. See vignettes for a detailed walk-through.
