# The whSample Package

***whSample*** helps analysts quickly generate statistical samples from Excel or Comma Separated Value (CSV) files and write them to a new Excel workbook. Users have a choice of Simple Random or Stratified Random samples, and a third choice of having each stratum included in a separate worksheet.

See package vignettes for detailed documentation.

## ssize

The workhorse function is *sampler*. A helper function, *ssize*, estimates the minimum sample size necessary to achieve statistical requirements using a Normal Approximation to the Hypergeometric Distribution. This distribution spans the probabilities of yes/no-type responses without replacement. These parameters are:

- **N**, the population size.
- **ci**, the required confidence interval. The default is 95%.
- **me**, the required level of precision, or margin of error. The default is +/- 7%.
- **p**, the anticipated rate of occurrence. The default is 50%.

*ssize(N, ci=0.95, me=0.07, p=0.50)* (showing the defaults) only requires the **N** argument. Used as a standalone, it can be used to explore sample sizes under other conditions. For example, a probe sample may suggest that a 50-50 probability isn't realistic. A revised sample size can be estimated with the observed success probability (p=0.6, for example).

## sampler

The *sampler* function calls *ssize* to get its sample size estimate. Therefore, it requires the **ci**, **me**, and **p** arguments, which it passes to *ssize*.

*sampler* also takes four additional arguments:

- **irisData** opens the file chooser to a folder with example files of Anderston's Iris dataset of flower characteristics.
- **backups** provides a buffer for use if necessary to replace samples found to be invalid for some reason,
- **seed** is used to seed the internal random number generator, and
- **keepOrg** determines if a copy of the population is included in the output.

The defaults for these arguments are *backups=5*, *irisData=F*, *seed=NULL*, and *keepOrg=T*. The default seed will tell *sampler* to use the current system time in milliseconds (a common seeding approach). The keep-original option (*keepOrg*) defaults to TRUE, but should be *keepOrg=F* for populations larger than about a million records since Excel's row limit is 1,048,576 and *sampler* adds some header and blank lines to its output.

To override any of these defaults, enter *name=value* as an argument.

*sampler* uses a series of menus to guide users through the sampling process.

## Output

*sampler* creates a new Excel workbook with three parts:

- a copy of the original (source) data,
- an Excel spreadsheet with the requested sample, and
- a new tab called *Report* with key reference information:

  - path and name of the source file
  - size (in rows) of the source file
  - sample type (Simple Random Sample, Stratified Random Sample, or Tabbed Stratified Sample)
  - sample size
  - number of strata
  - number of backups requested (this number is applied to every stratum in a stratified sample)
  - random number seed used, for documentation and reproducibility
  - date-time stamp of when the sample was generated
  
  - stratification information (name, number in the population, proportion of the population, and the number of samples)

## Installation

You can install *whSample* from CRAN with:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("whSample")
```

or get the latest developmental version with:

``` {r eval=F}
devtools::install_github("km4ivi/whSample")
```
### Other necessary packages

*sampler* depends on several external packages to run properly. If you're running a developmental version, make sure these packages are installed on your computer:

- tidyverse (or individually: magrittr, dplyr, purrr)
- openxlsx
- data.table
- tools
- utils
- tcltk
- bit64

## Examples

*ssize(5000)*: N=5000, other arguments use defaults

*ssize(5000, p=0.60)*: N=5000, with a 60% expected rate of occurrence

*sampler()*: Uses all defaults, gets N from the source data.

*sampler(backups=2, seed=12345)*: Overrides specific defaults
